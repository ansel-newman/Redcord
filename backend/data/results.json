Anyways, been out of the loop with deploying websites and web applications on a more professional level for a while. I took pause when I learned Kubernetes is considered basic knowledge now for web dev, and man... I know a bit about using Docker but seems that's not enough anymore. Kubernetes looks like nothing I can compare it to before. When I started coding professionally, most deployment at work was using (S)FTP. That is a relic in my career now. The moment I stopped using FTP, early 2010's, was also the moment I stopped doing anything with deployment. Everything I've coded in my post-FTP career no longer was my responsibility to deploy to production. I just know how to push to and sync with a private Git staging server and the rest of the pipeline might as well be a black box because \"let our team lead handle that\"."

Figuring there must be a lot of people like me who just want an app to enter their expenses and see how they're spending their money, I set out to learn RN and create this app. I was talking to my friend about how it works and he said he loves that his data stays on his device since it means it can't be sold - I had always considered that a weakness of the app but it is a strength in its own way."

Currently, it is possible to show clips from different channels based on the standard 1 day, 7 days, 30 days or All time that Twitch offers, alternatively switch to date-search and select a start date and optionally an end date to find clips from a specific timeframe.

Using the Font \"Be Vietnam Pro\" I see that Chrome-browsers are rendering it in the \"Extra Light\" variant, while all Safari-Browsers (including the Safari on iOS) are rendering it in the \"normal\" variant. This hehaviour happens only when I host the font by myself and not using Google Fonts. When just importing the google fonts files, even Chrome is using the \"normal\" font face. When using my own CDN, it instead uses the ExtraLight variant. How can I harmonize it so that all browsers use the ExtraLight-variant? My SCSS-File for fonts is:"

Ideally, this app will be embedded as a button, and when clicked, a modal will pop up that will display a workflow that includes form submissions. I looked through Shopify's dev documentation, and it seems that Shopify App Bridge/Polaris is used only for apps in Shopify Admin. Conversely, all the docs for theme extension apps point to using liquid files / simple HTML. My question is: Is it possible to create a theme extension app with React? If possible, will it be approved by the Shopify App store? Any documentation or resources will be greatly appreciated ‚Äî thanks in advance"
