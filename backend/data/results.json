Anyways, been out of the loop with deploying websites and web applications on a more professional level for a while. I took pause when I learned Kubernetes is considered basic knowledge now for web dev, and man... I know a bit about using Docker but seems that's not enough anymore. Kubernetes looks like nothing I can compare it to before. When I started coding professionally, most deployment at work was using (S)FTP. That is a relic in my career now. The moment I stopped using FTP, early 2010's, was also the moment I stopped doing anything with deployment. Everything I've coded in my post-FTP career no longer was my responsibility to deploy to production. I just know how to push to and sync with a private Git staging server and the rest of the pipeline might as well be a black box because \"let our team lead handle that\"."

Everything is accessible via things querySelector or getElementById even if you're in another component file.

I started this project about 2 years ago when I realized that I'd spent $300+ on a subscription-based similar app, and that I wasn't using the biggest feature - data sync across devices. Figuring there must be a lot of people like me who just want an app to enter their expenses and see how they're spending their money, I set out to learn RN and create this app. I was talking to my friend about how it works and he said he loves that his data stays on his device since it means it can't be sold - I had always considered that a weakness of the app but it is a strength in its own way."

Currently, it is possible to show clips from different channels based on the standard 1 day, 7 days, 30 days or All time that Twitch offers, alternatively switch to date-search and select a start date and optionally an end date to find clips from a specific timeframe.

Ideally, this app will be embedded as a button, and when clicked, a modal will pop up that will display a workflow that includes form submissions. I looked through Shopify's dev documentation, and it seems that Shopify App Bridge/Polaris is used only for apps in Shopify Admin. Conversely, all the docs for theme extension apps point to using liquid files / simple HTML. My question is: Is it possible to create a theme extension app with React? If possible, will it be approved by the Shopify App store? Any documentation or resources will be greatly appreciated — thanks in advance"
