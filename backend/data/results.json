The page, as you can see it on my GitHub domain, is exactly how it was supposed to look according to my initial mockup, so nothing wrong on that side. The problem is about how the overflow css property of a parent container (.page-wrapper) interacts with two other child elements (aside and .main) with afloat property applied to both of them (inspect the code and you'll know what I'm talking about, please). Now, in my head, the height of the parent container (which has a black border) should adapt naturally to contain all its child elements (which is basically the content of the entire page, included the two elements with ). But the point is: it does that only as far as I give it an property or if I delete the property I applied to the two child elements ( and ). Otherwise, its height will shrink to about 174 of the height of the entire page."

What is API Test Coverage?\nAPI test coverage shows how well the different parts of an API are tested. It focuses on making sure all possible requests and responses work as expected. This is different from regular test coverage, which checks how much of the source code is tested. Both are related because they ensure the overall quality and reliability of the software. Why This Matters:\nGood API test coverage means fewer bugs and a better user experience. By understanding your needs and challenges, I can help create tools that make testing easier and more effective."

The page, as you can see it on my GitHub domain, is exactly how it was supposed to look according to my initial mockup, so nothing wrong on that side. The problem is about how the overflow css property of a parent container (.page-wrapper) interacts with two other child elements (aside and .main) with afloat property applied to both of them (inspect the code and you'll know what I'm talking about, please). Now, in my head, the height of the parent container (which has a black border) should adapt naturally to contain all its child elements (which is basically the content of the entire page, included the two elements with ). But the point is: it does that only as far as I give it an property or if I delete the property I applied to the two child elements ( and ). Otherwise, its height will shrink to about 174 of the height of the entire page."

This is different from regular test coverage, which checks how much of the source code is tested. Both are related because they ensure the overall quality and reliability of the software. Why This Matters:\nGood API test coverage means fewer bugs and a better user experience. By understanding your needs and challenges, I can help create tools that make testing easier and more effective."

You are able to hold game covers (which are also a href elements) to access a quick menu which for the most part is fine, but if your connection is slower, it may not open as fast as expected and thus allows Safari to enter a sort of drag state on that element as shown in the image.

It's been 6-8 months since I've made anything with it and it seems like all the knowledge just vanished. When I posted about it on another subreddit, people went off on me saying it's because I learned from the books and tutorials and have not learned the documents by heart. It was convincing to me and that's why I'm gonna revise everything I did learn and learn more even from the original docs. But the question is how? I mean, I can grab my note book and start writing and memorizing every command and its function and learn them by heart. But I think that this is not the way to go because when I opened the docs I started with page one that had a link for page 2 that itself had a link for page three and I ended up opening five tabs just from a single \"start tutorial\" page.

I got to the point where I can create a web app for a small company, a bookstore, a news magazine or so without the need to open up the docs, tutorials the books or really anything. It's been 6-8 months since I've made anything with it and it seems like all the knowledge just vanished. When I posted about it on another subreddit, people went off on me saying it's because I learned from the books and tutorials and have not learned the documents by heart. It was convincing to me and that's why I'm gonna revise everything I did learn and learn more even from the original docs. But the question is how? I mean, I can grab my note book and start writing and memorizing every command and its function and learn them by heart. But I think that this is not the way to go because when I opened the docs I started with page one that had a link for page 2 that itself had a link for page three and I ended up opening five tabs just from a single \"start tutorial\" page. If I really have to go through it then I would but I thought to ask you all first. So, how do you go about learning from the documents? Thanks in advance!"

My own ideas include a simple php menu, a python or shell script that generates the menu manually or such. But maybe there are more modern ways of doing this today?

Well, let it be told, that since I got laid off I already have had 4 offers, they aren't great, but 3 of them weren't completely terrible. I signed one freelance offer (already worked there for a full week), and yesterday I signed one full-time contractor offer for a 12 month period. Both remote! The combined salary is a little lower than my previous job ($6.5k vs $4.8-$5.5k), but I will keep interviewing for something better.

Do checkout the settings section it has quite a good options to customize the look and functionalities, themes taken from monkeytype and you can customize your own theme too. I know that code is cluttered and state could have been managed way better had i planned well beforehand. Some of the features really taught me how much planning matters.

In reality it's a bit more complex like that, since the SVGs in question have multiple colours which all need to change, but you get the idea. This is easy enough with inline SVGs, or even SVGs as their own component. I can change the fill of individual paths however I want, and it works great. The issue I'm facing is that, long-term, I'm planning to upload A LOT of SVGs. So, I don't want to make an individual component for each SVG - I just want to upload them to a bucket in the correct format, and edit them by targeting the path IDs with CSS. But for some reason I'm hitting a wall - the CSS rules never apply to the SVGs."

I know how to do this if I roll my own auth, but I don't want my users to have to make a new account just to use my system. I'd rather leverage their existing business account via OAuth. All I really need is for my identity service to give me an organization ID associated with each user's account. This feels like the kind of thing that should be super common, but I couldn't find anything online on how to do it. Does anyone know how I can do this?

I want to use OAuth for my auth instead of rolling my own auth, but I have no idea how to identify which organization a user belongs to when authenticating them. I read about multi-tenant architecture online which seems like it's doing what I want, but I can't find an answer for \"given a user, determine what organization they belong to\". I know how to do this if I roll my own auth, but I don't want my users to have to make a new account just to use my system. I'd rather leverage their existing business account via OAuth. All I really need is for my identity service to give me an organization ID associated with each user's account. This feels like the kind of thing that should be super common, but I couldn't find anything online on how to do it. Does anyone know how I can do this? Or if this is the totally wrong approach and I should do something else entirely? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

What's the best way (cost effective and quickest solution) to get a website up and running quickly that can host products, variants, etc but without the cart or checkout?

These are implemented as legacy services with no containerization whatsoever. The IIS service hosts a .NET web application (phpMyAdmin) that allows the customers it serves to query the database from a web interface. These were implemented years ago from a previous colleague as a side project. We support a network security application primarily, and this web interface was initially a nicety that has now been firmly defined in the scope of the evergreen."

Authentification happens via an service user by username and password. There are no accounts for endusers or anything. I do have experience with Spring, Angular and Flutter and built a few full stack application. But I'm not sure if I should build that with a Spring backend. Though the API access can be restricted I still don't want to store the credentials frontend side because I can't implement any meaningful input validation and rate limits per IP. I'm a bit opposed of a full Spring backend since the functionality of the whole application is not much, it's basically taking inputs and forwarding them, nothing more."

My apps MVP is basically finished and now it’s time to implement user auth. I’m using a hand full of AWS microservices (Lambda, S3, and Dynamo). My plan is to use the Auth to validate users allowing them to make updates to the Dynamo Table (they only need access to a single field), my instinct is to use Cognito but after peaking at their documentation I want to blow my brains out. Hoping for some guidance on if my instincts are right to use Cognito and if I should bite the bullet and spend the next week figuring it out, or if there’s an easier method for a novice like myself."

The website is small for now, but I'm also considering adding a database and server-side functionality to manage user data.

This post didn't really help me, and my networking knowledge is weak in general. Say I've logged a user in and have an access token on the server side from my request to supabase, which authenticated the email/pw creds. The login response (to the client's login request) should set the browser's cookies which include this access token (as a JWT, for example).

Why is Angular so disliked ? I wonder if people who dislike it have real, legitimate reasons, if those people were pushed back by the learning curve, or if it's just a trend (like people who despise PHP but have actually never tried it). Basically I wanna separate the real, legitimate criticisms, from the junior developers who could not take 2 minutes to understand what rxjs is and does. Personally ? I used only Angular ever, didn't try Vue and React, so I can't really talk in an objective way. Only tried Svelte, liked it a lot, but it's very different from Angular so can't be compared IMO."

The websites looked pretty much basic and he wanted me to create something out of the box which look more futuristic. Travel+futuristic theme, I have never thought of it before. I proposed some designs to him and he was impressed. He gave me some edits in the design, however he told me to make it more attractive in a way where the visitor will be interacting more with the website. I actually thought of keeping this as a personal project of mine, but then he suddenly requested me to do the logo designing and the content writing part too. If he is satisfied with those he told me that he will handover the entire digital marketing contract to me. This is actually too much of work so I requested him to let me involve my team which I worked together in another project. He was ok with it(the project budget was not changed). I'm actually worried because my previous projects were based on technology and education. I barely have experience in the travel sector. Upto now everything went smoothly.

Given the many benefits of operating as an agency compared to freelancing, I've decided to start my own agency. After researching, I've found that most agencies now use WordPress or Shopify, which work well for both small and large-scale websites. These platforms shorten development time and provide clients with a CMS, eliminating extra costs. My question is, should I continue developing with React, or should I switch to WordPress or other tools? I doubt that the small companies I'll likely work with will care if the website is custom. They would probably prefer a straightforward solution. Using WordPress or Shopify would allow me to offer cheaper, more competitive prices since the development time would be shorter, further incentivizing clients."
