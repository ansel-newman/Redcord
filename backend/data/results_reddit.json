When we first started, we would present a wireframe before going into the design phase, but we stopped doing that pretty quickly because clients didn't understand what they were looking at. We received feedback like, \"Why is my website all black and white?\" to \"That's not my logo,\" to \"Why are the pictures just boxes with an 'X'?\" My favorite was, \"Who's Lorem Ipsum?\""

What is API Test Coverage?\nAPI test coverage shows how well the different parts of an API are tested. It focuses on making sure all possible requests and responses work as expected. This is different from regular test coverage, which checks how much of the source code is tested. Both are related because they ensure the overall quality and reliability of the software. Why This Matters:\nGood API test coverage means fewer bugs and a better user experience. By understanding your needs and challenges, I can help create tools that make testing easier and more effective."

The page, as you can see it on my GitHub domain, is exactly how it was supposed to look according to my initial mockup, so nothing wrong on that side. The problem is about how the overflow css property of a parent container (.page-wrapper) interacts with two other child elements (aside and .main) with afloat property applied to both of them (inspect the code and you'll know what I'm talking about, please). Now, in my head, the height of the parent container (which has a black border) should adapt naturally to contain all its child elements (which is basically the content of the entire page, included the two elements with ). But the point is: it does that only as far as I give it an property or if I delete the property I applied to the two child elements ( and ). Otherwise, its height will shrink to about 174 of the height of the entire page."

When we first started, we would present a wireframe before going into the design phase, but we stopped doing that pretty quickly because clients didn't understand what they were looking at. We received feedback like, \"Why is my website all black and white?\" to \"That's not my logo,\" to \"Why are the pictures just boxes with an 'X'?\" My favorite was, \"Who's Lorem Ipsum?\""

This is different from regular test coverage, which checks how much of the source code is tested. Both are related because they ensure the overall quality and reliability of the software. Why This Matters:\nGood API test coverage means fewer bugs and a better user experience. By understanding your needs and challenges, I can help create tools that make testing easier and more effective."

The page, as you can see it on my GitHub domain, is exactly how it was supposed to look according to my initial mockup, so nothing wrong on that side. The problem is about how the overflow css property of a parent container (.page-wrapper) interacts with two other child elements (aside and .main) with afloat property applied to both of them (inspect the code and you'll know what I'm talking about, please). Now, in my head, the height of the parent container (which has a black border) should adapt naturally to contain all its child elements (which is basically the content of the entire page, included the two elements with ). But the point is: it does that only as far as I give it an property or if I delete the property I applied to the two child elements ( and ). Otherwise, its height will shrink to about 174 of the height of the entire page."

I’m aiming for the Coursera Meta FE Professional Certification. My main reason for considering it is that I’m currently unemployed and feel I have not show enough credibility as FE dev.

I've been working on 7 different projects for different clients, with tech differing from Angular to React and Vue.

My own ideas include a simple php menu, a python or shell script that generates the menu manually or such. But maybe there are more modern ways of doing this today?

I'm concerned that the pixel density (PPI) on the 27\" might be an issue for design work. Does anyone have experience with 27\" 2K monitors? Any suggestions (of other monitors too) or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'll be using it with my MacBook Pro, if that makes a difference.

The Technician and Operator apps are used for data entry. The current setup is that the client retrieves what it needs from the server every time it loads a view. Some views load a sync route, that syncs a limited amount of data to the client (i.e. well names, lift station names, meta data). When the app is online, buttons for wells and lift stations appear red (if unread for the day) and green (if read).

I'm a DIY guy that likes to avoid dependencies, so I started coding it using the Web Audio API, and it's working fine so far.

I released a first version that has enough features and which I was confortable sharing.\nI'm proud to have been able to build and release a project for the first time. so here you go :) Hope it will be useful for you.

But what about simple elements that are just a single tag, like h4, p, a... and there is NO structure. You can't convince me that I must define components for h4 and p when CSS is all that it takes. Or even a worse solution to repeat all damn utility classes for every h4, p... tag in the app, so there are responsive classes for font-size, line-height, vertical margins and that is by design from the framework? That is just inline CSS with a config file for few vars. No one can convince me that is reasonable, maintainable and practical."

The app is completely free, so there's no barrier to entry for users. I've tried a few different ways to market the app:\nI hired a dropshipping youtuber to promote the app, but the results have been very disappointing."

This is easy enough with inline SVGs, or even SVGs as their own component. I can change the fill of individual paths however I want, and it works great. The issue I'm facing is that, long-term, I'm planning to upload A LOT of SVGs. So, I don't want to make an individual component for each SVG - I just want to upload them to a bucket in the correct format, and edit them by targeting the path IDs with CSS. But for some reason I'm hitting a wall - the CSS rules never apply to the SVGs."

I know how to do this if I roll my own auth, but I don't want my users to have to make a new account just to use my system. I'd rather leverage their existing business account via OAuth. All I really need is for my identity service to give me an organization ID associated with each user's account.

My website allows multiple organizations to use my website, but I want to make sure that users from one organization cannot access data from another organization. I want to use OAuth for my auth instead of rolling my own auth, but I have no idea how to identify which organization a user belongs to when authenticating them. I read about multi-tenant architecture online which seems like it's doing what I want, but I can't find an answer for \"given a user, determine what organization they belong to\". I know how to do this if I roll my own auth, but I don't want my users to have to make a new account just to use my system. I'd rather leverage their existing business account via OAuth. All I really need is for my identity service to give me an organization ID associated with each user's account. This feels like the kind of thing that should be super common, but I couldn't find anything online on how to do it. Does anyone know how I can do this? Or if this is the totally wrong approach and I should do something else entirely? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

I realise OpenAI have their own version of voice but I started work on this app months before it was announced and I feel like there is room to do things a little differently. If anything, I just hope that it is an immersive experience, a bit of a different way to interact with some fun and diverse characters. The website is a nextJS app with full authentication with a postgres backend plus a couple of other features such as translation and image generation. I would love to get the feedback from people on the sub and any recommendations or requests you might have, I know the UI/UX is not up to scratch yet. In the near future I have plans for a number of updates including multilingual voice support, whisper voice integration allowing realtime voice to voice conversations (in testing now) and much more.

From the outside things appeared normal and customers were seemingly satisfied with their level of service, but when I was on the inside working on the systems I realized how fragile and in some cases, archaic, some of them were. At the time, staring at the backlog and realizing how many bugs needed addressing, I wondered how it was possible anything actually worked! To be fair, most critical things were triaged and addressed in a timely manner (as timely as possible for a large organization anyway) and of course it's nigh impossible to reach backlog zero when a healthy company is introducing new products and features."

Is there a free way to do this, and/or a way that doesn't require going through the hoops of having the app \"validated\" by the app store ? I'm thinking pretty simple stuff, e.g. an app to help me manage the inventory in my cold room, so all in all a rather simple CRUD thing. So far I've made a few PWAs, they've always suited my needs, I just want to expand my horizons. Thanks for your input !"
